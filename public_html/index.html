        <h1>Repository project</h1>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>A repository is where all the re-used and compiled software is stored.</p>
        <p>It is basically an FTP server with certain users, groups and a specific directory structure. It's reachable for any client who has the appropriate credits.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Installation is done by a Python script which creates the underlying directory structure.</p>
        <h2>Access</h2>
        <p>By any FTP client which knows the IP and the Port of the repository and can authenticate itself.</p>
        <h3>Access rights</h3>
        <p>Clients can only access the protected directory of their firm, ie. client.com's user can only access /protected/com.client/ directory.</p>
        <h2>Types of software</h2>
        <h3>public</h3>
        <p>Software which is reachable by anyone who has a login.</p>
        <h3>protected</h3>
        <p>Software which is shared between the client and us. This software might be confidential between the client and us. It must not reachable by other clients than the one, whose project is using it.</p>
        <h3>private</h3>
        <p>Software which is not to be shared the public nor any client.</p>
        <h2>Rolling ideas</h2>
        <h3>These ideas are to built into the repository as it evolves. It's just a bulletin; no dependencies are illustrated here.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Compatibility with Ivy repositories</li>
            <li>Compatibility with Maven repositories</li>
        </ul>
